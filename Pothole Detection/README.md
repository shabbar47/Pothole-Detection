potholes-detection

•	This android application can detect potholes automatically using Artificial Intelligence without
the need of user to look out for them and change their route.
•	The app automatically captures an image of pothole and gets the location using GPS and send it
to the government authority to fix the potholes. The app has inbuilt map to make a travel plan, in which the detected potholes will get stored and pops an alert if the user’s travel route has too many potholes.
